// In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

// Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
// but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
// but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
// Tested years are in range 1600 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 4000.

function isLeapYear(year) {
    // given a year that is an int -> return a boolean
    return year % 400 === 0 || (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) 
  }
