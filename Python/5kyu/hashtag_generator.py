# The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
# Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

# Here's the deal:

# It must start with a hashtag (#).
# All words must have their first letter capitalized.
# If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
# If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
# Examples
# " Hello there thanks for trying my Kata"  =>  "#HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata"
# "    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
# ""                                        =>  false

def generate_hashtag(s):
    words = [i.capitalize() for i in s.split(' ') if i != "" ]
    result = '#' + ''.join(words)
    if len(result)>140 or not s:
        return False
    return result

# top solution
def generate_hashtag(s):
    output = "#"
    
    for word in s.split():
        output += word.capitalize()
    
    return False if (len(s) == 0 or len(output) > 140) else output
