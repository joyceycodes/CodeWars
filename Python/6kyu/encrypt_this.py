# Encrypt this!

# You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

# Your message is a string containing space separated words.
# You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
# The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
# The second letter must be switched with the last letter
# Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.
# Examples:
# encrypt_this("Hello") == "72olle"
# encrypt_this("good") == "103doo"
# encrypt_this("hello world") == "104olle 119drlo"

def encrypt_this(text):
    text = text.split()
    encrypted_word = ''
    for word in text:
        encrypted_word += str(ord(word[0]))
        if len(word) > 2:
            encrypted_word += word[-1]
            encrypted_word += word[2:-1]
            encrypted_word += word[1]
        else:
            encrypted_word += word[1:]
        encrypted_word += ' '
    return encrypted_word.strip()

def encrypt_this(text):
    result = []
    
    for word in text.split():
        # turn word into a list
        word = list(word)
        
        # replace first letter with ascii code
        word[0] = str(ord(word[0]))
        
        # switch 2nd and last letters
        if len(word) > 2:
            word[1], word[-1] = word[-1], word[1]
